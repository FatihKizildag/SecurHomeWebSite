"Home Automation System" Project

This project includes a web application that allows users to control their home appliances, manage alarms, and automate their homes by adding other features. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP are used in this project.

Features

User Login: Users can log in to the system with their registered accounts.

Control of Home Appliances: Users can turn their home appliances on/off and check their status through the web interface. For example, turning lights on/off, changing thermostat settings, monitoring security cameras, etc.

Alarm Management: Users can manage alarms and set alarm triggers for emergency situations such as burglary, fire, etc. They can also send notifications to the administrator in case of alarm events.

Monthly Energy Consumption: After logging in, users can access a table that shows their monthly energy consumption. This table helps users make conscious decisions for energy savings.

Contact Section: Non-registered users can access a contact section to submit complaints and requests. This contact section allows users to reach the administrator and provide feedback.
